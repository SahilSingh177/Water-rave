## Inspiration
The inspiration behind this project was to create a platform where people can share their reviews and experiences regarding the quality of water in their area.

## Features
- Read and write reviews about the water quality in your area
- Search for reviews by location
- View average rating of each location
- Report water quality issues directly to local authorities (planned feature)

## Technologies Used
- React.js for the frontend
- Node.js and Express.js for the backend
- MongoDB for the database

## Challenges Faced
The main challenge we faced was designing an intuitive and user-friendly UI that would be easy to navigate for users of all ages and backgrounds. Additionally, we had to figure out how to accurately calculate the average rating for each place.

## Accomplishments
We are proud of creating a functional website within a limited timeframe that addresses an important social issue. We were able to design an attractive and intuitive UI and implement a feature that calculates the average rating of each place.

## What We Learned
Through this project, we learned how to use React.js to create responsive and attractive UIs. We also learned how to integrate a database and API calls into a web application.

## Future Plans
In the future, we plan to expand the website's functionality by adding features such as a map view that shows the location of each reviewed place and a feature that allows users to report water quality issues directly to local authorities. We also plan to optimize the website's performance and improve its accessibility for users with disabilities.
